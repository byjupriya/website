        <p>LLS aims to make the lives of cancer patients easier through 3 mission pillars: Patient support, advocacy, and research. They also host various events and fundraisers to raise money - including the Student Visionaries of the Year program. I am glad that Adishree is a candidate for this program so that we can all find a way to contribute to this cause, and learn to code along the way.</p>
